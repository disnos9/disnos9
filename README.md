# hi, i'm dino.
i do multiple things, like create cool projects, find exploits, and more. if you are a student, check out [GitHub student developer pack! it gives you over $10,000+ in benefits](https://education.github.com/pack) including GitHub Pro for free!<br><br>

Honestly I came here today thinking I would know what to type. I have no clue what to write. whatever lol
